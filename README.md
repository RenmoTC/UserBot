   - This bot is intended for the purpose of having fun with memes,
   - As well as efficiently managing groups.
   - You ended up spamming groups, getting reported left and right,
   - And you ended up in a Finale Battle with Telegram and at the end
   - Telegram Team deleted your account?
   - And after that, then you pointed your fingers at us
   - For getting your acoount deleted?
   - I will be rolling on the floor laughing at you.
